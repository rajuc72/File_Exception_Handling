        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The main difference between compiled languages and interpreted language is lies in executing/running the program. If the program contains error/s the compiled language wont execute the whole program , while in interpreted languages the program executes until the error/s occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: In simple words exception handling is a way of communicating with the compiler how to treat the block of code even if there are errors , and to know the exact error description .\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The Final block executed in all situations irrespective of the error messages or logging issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Logging is a mechanism to know the program status , in other words. Python logging is a module that allows you to track events that occur while your program is running.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the   deI\t method in Python*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:  In Python everything is an object, method  __del__ is a finalizer. It is called when an object is garbage collected which happens at some point after all references to the object have been deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: import meaning loading whole package/library files , on the other hand from…import means loading necessary packages or modules from that library.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python*\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: with statement simplifies file handling by automatically closing the file when the block of code is exited, even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Thread is nothing but processing a single unit of process, a process contains multiple threads. Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory space and executes concurrently. .\n",
        "Multiprocessing uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space, allowing for true parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Logging helps track events, debug issues, record system activity, and monitor the application's behavior over time. It provides valuable insights for troubleshooting and maintaining software programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Memory management in Python involves the allocation, deallocation, and reuse of memory to optimize the performance and efficiency of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Try: Enclose the code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "Except: Handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
        "Else: Execute code if no exceptions are raised.\n",
        "Finally: Execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Memory management helps to maintain the memory efficiently. Like, with the help of garbage collection techniques we can deallocate or free-up the unwanted memory. So that we can allocate the same memory to other resources if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling*\n",
        "Ans: The try block contains code that might raise an exception, while the except block contains code to handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Python's garbage collection system automatically deallocates memory that is no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The else block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block. It allows for clean execution of code that should only run if the try block is successful.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: DEBUG: Detailed information of problem diagnosing.\n",

        "ERROR: A more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
        "CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:os.fork () Creates a new process by duplicating the current process. It’s limited to Unix-like operating systems.Multiprocessing allows creating and managing multiple processes across different operating systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python*\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readIine() in Python*\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "21.What is the logging module in Python used for*\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The logging module is used to track events that happen when some software runs. It allows for logging messages at different severity levels and helps in debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system, including file handling operations like creating, removing, and checking the existence of files and directories.\n",
